Homework: HTML Contact Page
=======

Introduction
--------
Our web development team has gone on a Lake Tahoe vacation after they released the latest code for our contact page. The page looks fantastic!

In this folder is an HTML file called 'index.html' and a directory called 'assets'. Running the 'index.html' file will show the contact page for the Ubermelon corporate site in your web browser.

Take a look at the 'index.html' file and get an idea of how it works.


Problem
--------
The page looks fantastic but the customer service department is getting calls about a few things being difficult.

Things such as:
* The subtitle is a little intimidating
* People are complaining the headers seem to be yelling
* The new logo image needs to replace the old one
* The product line seems limited
* The email address isn't clickable

Solutions Suggested:
* The product team took off with the web team. Come up with a temporary subtitle that less aggresive.
* Change the headers (h3) to be lowercase
* Change the logo being used from rsz_logo.jpg to logo.jpg
* Add 2 pictures of melons to the carousel
* Wrap the email link on the bottom of the page in a link
