Homework: Sales Report
=======

Problem:
-------
In this folder is the file `sales_report.csv`, which contains a line for each order placed, containing the salesperson's name, total amount of the order and total number of melons sold.

The `sales_report.py` script  displays a report of the total number of melons sold by each sales person.

Take a look at the `sales_report.py` script and figure out how it works.  You don't need to code a better solution.  What are some inefficiencies in the script?  What would be nice to have to make it better/faster?
