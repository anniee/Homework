Homework 06b - More Classes

Introduce code that runs our robotic production and delivery chain.  It works great with our Melon classes, but now "Winter(squash) is Coming" so we need to make a squash class.

Demonstrate that we can now send our squash class through the robotic production line without needing to change any code on the robot side.
