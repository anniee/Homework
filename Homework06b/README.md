Subject: *URGENT* Winter(Squash) is Coming!

Fantastic work lately!  Thanks to you and your improvements, our
orders have gone up 500%!

To keep up with demand, our CEO has invested billions of VC money in a 
brand new robotic production and delivery chain!  It's a real thing of 
beauty.

It's been working great with our regular melon objects, but I'm sure by
now you've heard of our new campaign: "Winter(Squash) is Coming!".  Early
testing with the Winter Squash has not been going well.  Seems like the 
Robots keep rejecting the Winter Squash since they're yellow, not green.

We contacted the manufacturer and changing the code on the robots to allow
both green *and* yellow melons would apparently cost another billion dollars.
They did offer to sell us a PainterBot for only $100 Million that would paint
the Winter Squash green.  The CEO *loved* this idea.  In fact, he may want to
paint all non-green melons in the future.  To invoke the paint bot, call the 
following function:

  robots.painterbot.paint(melon)

We anticipate even more new specialty melons in the near future, notably our
Kobe Melon, Tanzanian Devil Squash, Lobster Melons, and the ever popular 
micro musk melon. Please make sure the code can cleanly accommodate these new
products and their distinct prep procedures.

I'm attaching our "shipping_procedure.py" code that processes our orders.  I'm
also including a copy of our robots code ("robots.py"), but remember, changing
any code in that file would bankrupt us.  Also, I'm attaching two order log
files. The first currently works, but the second contains the Winter Squash 
that is failing.

I'd like you to create a new class for Winter Squash that makes sure they
get painted green.

Thanks,
Mel
