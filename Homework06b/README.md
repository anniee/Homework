Homework 06b - More Classes

Introduce code that runs our robotic production and delivery chain.  It works great with our Melon classes, but now "Winter(squash) is Coming" so we need to make a squash class.

Demonstrate that we can now send our squash class through the robotic production line without needing to change any code on the robot side.

Our list of standing orders now includes winter squashes as well as melons, but the robots are not painting the squashes with a watermelon color scheme. Please update the robot control script to do so as appropriate. To invoke the paint bot, call the following function:
    
    robots.PainterBot.watermelonize(melon)

We anticipate a few more classes of specialty melons in the near future, notably, our Kobe Melon, Tanzanian Devil Squash, Lobster Melons, and the ever popular micro musk melon. Please make sure the code can cleanly accommodate these new products and their distinct prep procedures.
