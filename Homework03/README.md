Homework: Accounting
=======

Problem:
-------
"OH NO!! The CEO has JUST informed me last night, that our accounting team was poached by Chad from Squysh.

Fortunately, I was able to get some new dev hires through earlier today from a local bootcamp, they are even less experienced than you but their rates are highly competitive:

There is still an issue though. Before they officially joined today, I ended up having to write some code myself, to basically do the job the four accountants were doing.

The problem is that my new jr. jr. programming team is not understanding the code I wrote [https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Homework/blob/master/Homework03/accounting.py]

Can you help rewrite it so that it's more understandable?

As I understand it... here are the four processes that our accountants handled"

Someone counted up the differerent melons that were sold

Someone calculated the revenue from those melon tallies

Someone calculated the cost to sell those mellons

Someone produced a fancy report to summarize the information for our CEO
