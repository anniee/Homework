Homework: Reports from log files
=======

Problem 1:
-------
Hey there,

So the CEO wants a summary report on the melons we delivered to figure out what's going on.

Here's the code we have so far:
https://github.com/hackbrightacademy/Homework/blob/master/Homework02/produce_summary.py

The guy who started it, has now left to start his own startup, Squiysh ("Lyft for WinterSquash").

He had partially written the code, but it doesn't work. It should print the date of delivery, melonType, and the status of the delivery. Instead, it only prints melonType three times.

We need you to fix that...

Also the CEO always ignores email, so we need the messages to be in ALL CAPS!

Thanks,
Team Lead


Problem 2:
--------

Hey great job so far,

There's just one more thing to fix- the code's a little hard to read because there's so much going on. Functions should help make things a bit easier on the eyes...

Sincererely,
Team Lead

ps: I also heard him talking about putting stars around the statuses for some reason. Have you heard anything about that??
