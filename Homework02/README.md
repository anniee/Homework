Subject: *URGENT* Report needed for CEO!

Hey there,

We've been trying to deliver the weekly summary report to the CEO, but
something is broken with the script.  The script used to work fine, 
but I think the folks in fulfillment must have changed the format of the
delivery logs or something.  Now we just get an error!  

I'm hoping you can help!  We need to deliver this report ASAP!

I've attached the code we have so far in the file produce_summary.py along
with delivery logs for the last three weeks.  The guy who started it, has 
now left to start his own startup, Squiysh ("Lyft for WinterSquash")
and you're the only developer left on the team that knows python.

If it helps, we know the correct count for the melons delivered on 4/30
is 515 and the order total for that day was $1,904.35.

Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead

Hey great job so far, the CEO really appreciated that report.

I'm really concerned that this report might break again.  I think the
code is a little hard to read because there's so much going on.  Is there
anything you can do to make it better?  Maybe throw in some functions?

Sincererely,
