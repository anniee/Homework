Homework: Reports from log files
=======

Problem 1:

You just received this email from your team lead:

```
To: jrdev48@ubermelon.co <Junior Developer #48>

Subject: *URGENT* Report needed for CEO!

Hey there,

So the CEO wants a summary report on the melons we delivered to get an idea of how well we're doing.

I've attached the code we have so far in the file produce_summary.py.  The guy who started it, has 
now left to start his own startup, Squiysh ("Lyft for WinterSquash").

He had partially written the code, but it doesn't work. It should print the date of delivery, 
melonType, and the status of the delivery. Instead, it only prints the melonType three times.

We need you to fix that asap...

Also the CEO always ignores email, so we need the messages to be in ALL CAPS!

Thanks,
Mel
Team Lead

Hey great job so far,

There's just one more thing to fix- the code's a little hard to read because there's so much 
going on. Functions should help make things a bit easier on the eyes...

Sincererely,
Team Lead

ps: I also heard him talking about putting stars around the statuses for some reason. Have you 
heard anything about that??
